# The category of Compact Hausdorff Spaces

We construct the category of compact Hausdorff spaces.
The type of compact Hausdorff spaces is denoted `CompHaus`, and it is endowed with a category
instance making it a full subcategory of `Top`.
The fully faithful functor `CompHaus ⥤ Top` is denoted `CompHaus_to_Top`.

**Note:** The file `topology/category/Compactum.lean` provides the equivalence between `Compactum`,
which is defined as the category of algebras for the ultrafilter monad, and `CompHaus`.
`Compactum_to_CompHaus` is the functor from `Compactum` to `CompHaus` which is proven to be an
equivalence of categories in `Compactum_to_CompHaus.is_equivalence`.
See `topology/category/Compactum.lean` for a more detailed discussion where these definitions are
introduced.
